# Elevate Lab Final Project: Shark Tank India & Telecom Churn Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains two complementary data analysis components. First, an interactive Shark Tank India dashboard built in Tableau, visualizing startup deal metrics (e.g. funding amounts, investor offers, and founder demographics). Second, a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a telecom customer churn dataset using Python and SQL. For the telecom analysis, data was extracted from the database using SQL (a common data analyst task

. Together, these projects demonstrate end-to-end data processing skills: pulling and querying data, and creating rich visual insights.
