Elevate Lab Final Project: Shark Tank India & Telecom Churn Analysis
Overview
This repository contains two complementary data analysis components. First, an interactive Shark Tank India dashboard built in Tableau, visualizing startup deal metrics (e.g. funding amounts, investor offers, and founder demographics). Second, a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a telecom customer churn dataset using Python and SQL. For the telecom analysis, data was extracted from the database using SQL (a common data analyst task

) and then analyzed in Python, performing EDA to understand the data’s structure and churn-related distributions

. Together, these projects demonstrate end-to-end data processing skills: pulling and querying data, and creating rich visual insights.
Features
Shark Tank India Dashboard (Tableau): Interactive visualizations including Funding Amount by Industry, Offer & Acceptance Rates by Industry, Founder Gender Composition, Deal Conversion by Startup, and an Ask vs Deal Amount scatter plot. These charts help highlight trends and patterns in Shark Tank deals.
Telecom Churn Analysis (Python & SQL): SQL scripts extract and aggregate the telecom dataset (e.g. total customers, churn rates by segment). A Jupyter Notebook performs thorough EDA: data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations (such as churn distribution, correlations, demographics vs. churn). Insights include factors contributing to churn, as well as usage and demographic patterns.
Technologies Used
Tableau: Dashboard creation for Shark Tank India analytics.
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn used in Jupyter for data cleaning, analysis, and plotting.
SQL: MySQL (or any SQL engine) used to query and summarize the telecom churn data.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for executing the telecom EDA code.
Git & GitHub: Version control and collaboration platform for the project.
How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
Shark Tank Dashboard: Open the provided Tableau workbook (e.g. SharkTankDashboard.twbx) in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public to view and interact with the dashboard. No code execution is needed for this visualization.
Telecom Churn EDA: Ensure Python 3 is installed. Install the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) via pip. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open EDA OF TELECOM CHURN.ipynb. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and plots.
SQL Analysis: Optionally, load the telecom customer data into a SQL database. Then execute the SQL analysis.sql script in your SQL environment (for example: mysql> SOURCE SQL analysis.sql;) to run the example queries and summaries.
