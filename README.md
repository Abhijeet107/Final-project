# Elevate Lab Final Project: Shark Tank India & Telecom Churn Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains two complementary data analysis components. First, an interactive Shark Tank India dashboard built in Tableau, visualizing startup deal metrics (e.g. funding amounts, investor offers, and founder demographics). Second, a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a telecom customer churn dataset using Python and SQL. For the telecom analysis, data was extracted from the database using SQL (a common data analyst task

) and then analyzed in Python, performing EDA to understand the dataâ€™s structure and churn-related distributions

. Together, these projects demonstrate end-to-end data processing skills: pulling and querying data, and creating rich visual insights.

## Features

- Shark Tank India Dashboard (Tableau): Interactive visualizations including Funding Amount by Industry, Offer & Acceptance Rates by Industry, Founder Gender Composition, Deal Conversion by Startup, and an Ask vs Deal Amount scatter plot. These charts help highlight trends and patterns in Shark Tank deals.
  
-Telecom Churn Analysis (Python & SQL): SQL scripts extract and aggregate the telecom dataset (e.g. total customers, churn rates by segment). A Jupyter Notebook performs thorough EDA: data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations (such as churn distribution, correlations, demographics vs. churn). Insights include factors contributing to churn, as well as usage and demographic patterns.
